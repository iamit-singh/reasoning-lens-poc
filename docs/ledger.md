# Hours ledger

One line per work session (C10.5). Reviewed at month end; **the cumulative figure is what
releases the Option-2 contingency at G2.** This file is the C10.1 contingency trigger —
keep it honest, including when it is unflattering.

> **The live tracker is the shared view of this same data:**
> [Reasoning Lens Month 1](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d80de125-0d48-4546-a7b4-d1642af07ede)
> — task status, hours, the G0/G1 checklists and the Appendix D decisions. It is backed by
> a database, so it is what other people read. **Update both, or update the tracker and
> regenerate this file** — two ledgers that disagree are worse than one.

| Date | Week | Task | Hrs | Note |
|------------|------|-------|-----|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2026-09-10 | W1 | §11 | 0.3 | Day-1 unblock: four Appendix D asks drafted. **None sent** — each needs a human. D#1 default taken and recorded (Option 2, L1+L2 applied now) |
| 2026-09-10 | W1 | M1-3 | 0.4 | S5 DNS: ADR-003 written, ticket text ready to file verbatim. **Not filed** — no ticket ID, no named owner yet |
| 2026-09-10 | W1 | M1-1 | 0.8 | S1 harness written + self-tested (alias refusal, no-key path). ADR-001 committed as *Proposed* with all 4 branches pre-decided. **Run blocked: no API key** |
| 2026-09-10 | W1 | M1-0 | 1.5 | CI green across all 9 every-PR jobs; import-linter contract proven by a deliberate violation (`23defe3`) then reverted (`7b1ae59`) |

## Month-1 planned-vs-actual

| Week | Planned (breakdown) | Actual | Δ | Notes |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --------- |
| W1 | 3.8 | 3.0 | −0.8 | M1-1 partial: harness done, run blocked on a key. M1-3 filed-by-human pending |
| W2 | 5.7 | | | |
| W3 | 7.5 | | | |
| W4 | 8.0 | | | |
| **Total** | **25.0** *(24.7 + 0.3 §11)* | | | |
| *vs. C10.2 Realistic* | 22.0 | | | *+3.0 = the four §1.3 gaps, less L1/L2* |
| *vs. Lead capacity* | 12.0 | | | *the C10.1 bet, first reading at end W4* |

> **⚠️ The W1 actual is not yet a signal.** M1-0 came in on estimate, but W1 is the
> cheapest week and the two items still open are both blocked on other people rather than
> on effort. The first reading that means anything is **end of W4**.
